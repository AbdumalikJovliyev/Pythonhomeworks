# #### Task 1: Create a Library Management System with Custom Exceptions
# 1. Create a Python program to manage a small library system. 
# 2. Define custom exceptions for specific scenarios:
#    - **`BookNotFoundException`**: Raised when trying to borrow a book that doesnâ€™t exist in the library.
#    - **`BookAlreadyBorrowedException`**: Raised when a book is already borrowed.
#    - **`MemberLimitExceededException`**: Raised when a member tries to borrow more books than allowed.
# 3. Implement classes for:
#    - **`Book`**: Attributes include `title`, `author`, and `is_borrowed`.
#    - **`Member`**: Attributes include `name`, `borrowed_books` (limit to 3 books per member).
#    - **`Library`**: Manages books and members, including borrowing and returning books.
# 4. Test your program with the following scenarios:
#    - Adding books and members.
#    - Borrowing and returning books.
#    - Handling exceptions when rules are violated.
